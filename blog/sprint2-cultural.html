        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

        <dev>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>I want to become some sort of web or app developer. I want to do something involving coding, I do love creating something from nothing and being able to sit back at the end and be able to say I did that and feel proud and everything to do with coding so far I have liked and I like the challange of it. If I get to a point oneday where I don't want to become a developer I will join the police force or get a qualification like engeneer trough the army. I hope I do enjoy EDA and learn a lot and want to carry it on once I finished.</p>

            <h2 class="left-margin">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>I can be quite akward which does restrict my networking skills and I am also shy but I am trying to be more open to people. I would like EDA help me learn networking skills. I think these would help me in busniess envoroments but also in general life and would also help my general social skills.</p>

            <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>I think my strengths are my determination which does get me trough hard tasks and help me push trough challanges I don't want to do. I think it is my determination that has gotten me this far in life especually around exam time in high school. On of my weeknesses are that I am not detail oriented enough so I can easly skip over small details that are important but I do normally focous on the task as a whole and when I am done I don't come back to fill in the details like I should.</p>

            <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
            <p>I will set up a schedule and try stick to it. It will take into account how long I can work for without losing my mind and and it will also judge how much time I can take off work to regather myself. I think working for too many hours in a week will have a negative effect on the following weeks work load and how much of it I would be able to get done of it and also the quality of work I would be putting out. I will also try go get through the hardest work at the start of the week, this will let me take more time on the rest of the stuff and do better on the work as a ressult.</p>

            <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
            <p>I will ask in the slacks clannels because there are lots of experenced coders in there that may be able to help me out but first I will check the web, in sites like stackoverflow and w3schools becaues I know they were good and I have used them before. I can also use people around me like the tutors and other students.</p>

            <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p>I expect help or advide when I ask for it.</p>

            <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p>I do not have anyting planned during EDA bootcamp time.</p>
