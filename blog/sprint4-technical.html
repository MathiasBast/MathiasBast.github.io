        <h1>Approach to Problem Solving</h1>

        <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            The problem I had was the gradebook  activity where I make a function that does add all the people and their scores into a 
            gradebook so it would not need to be done manually. The problem I had was when I made it, the students' names were in a list 
            instead of an object like I needed. Because I made it like that pretty quick and thought I was done but it was saying there 
            was a problem, so I checked the first gradebook I entered manually and the names were objects with a scoreList property which 
            was equal to their score. I could not make the students' objects.
        </p>

        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
        <p>
            I did google it a lot, watch youtube videos, talk to my dog what was happening and wrote some pseudocode to keep and idea. 
            I think they did all help a bit but there was a lot of stuff I didn't need to get trough when I googled the problem before I 
            found something I thought would be helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
        <p>
            I was very annoyed because I knew it had a simple solution because I think I have done it before or something similar in 
            FreeCodeCamp. When I finished it felt good and I was very happy.
        </p>

        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
        <p>
            I learned that it is not always the most complicated solution that's best because sometimes a simple one works just fine, 
            and also makes the code more readable. I did also learn to go over your old work for example because that can be helpful.
        </p>

        <h2>Solved a Problem In An Elegant Way</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            On the "Super-FizzBuzz" challenge I did rearrange the "if" and "if else" so it would check if there was a multiple of 15 then 5 
            then 3 because 15 is a multiple of 5 and 3 so it would come out as "FizzBuzz" which I was quite happy when I found it out because 
            it was simple and I thought it was elegant and easy. 
        </p>

        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
        <p>
            I did use trial and error mostly, it was not a big big problem and I did solve it pretty quick so there was no need to google it 
            or do anything else to solve it. I did really just think about it for a few minutes
        </p>

        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
        <p>
            I was amused when I solved it because it was so easy because all I needed to do was rearrange the if statements.
        </p>

        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
        <p>
            I learned I don't always need google and how you order if and else if statements really matter and can make a big difference.
        </p>


        <h2>Most Useful Problem Solving Techniques For Me</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li>Pseudocode-I do write a lot of comments when I get to better understand my code</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rubber ducky method(taking to my dog)- I do talk to my dog when it's next to me and I get stuck to help me explain things.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Console.logging- Putting the returns into the console to see what the output is and compare it to the output I want.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Googling- I do google the problem and go on websites like MDN and SstackOverFlow to help me.</li>
        </ul>
