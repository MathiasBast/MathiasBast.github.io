        <h1>Reflection of Foundation Core Skills</h1>

        <h2 class="left-margin">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li>
                I learned that my brain changes shape and I can use that to learn better and more effectively which I will try to remember 
                for the rest of my life and use as much as I can.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I did learn I need to practice something as soon as I read about it or watch a video about it. For example, when I learned 
                about .map function I did not practice with it enough so I need to do that before I can 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I did find out that I need to slow down sometimes and take care with what I do. I have miss spelled stuff that has made my 
                code not work and its just a small thing but I do have to go through a lot just to figure it out.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="left-margin">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            You need values, empathy and self-awareness do help you get a job. If there is someone better than you at coding 
            (and there always is) you can still get the job if you show these skills because people want people who can work well 
            with other people because you can relate to them. Because of this, you will be more effective in a team and can get 
            much more work done.
        </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            The thing that surprised me the most was that I could relate almost everything I learned to past experience I have had, 
            and how I could have used them to better myself and my relationships with others. For example, if I knew about emotional 
            intelligence longer ago I would have handled myself differently when interacting with people I didn't like. I was quite 
            petty with some people I didn't like or would be passive aggressive to another. 
        </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            I found the meditation the most challenging because I hadn't done it before and as a result of this it was hard to stay 
            still for so long while doing nothing but focusing on my breath, but it did get easier and easier the more I did it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think so much time is spent on it because at the end of the Bootcamp we should be able to get a job and if you do not 
            display some of the stuff we learned in core it will be much more difficult to get a job. Some of the core stuff we learned 
            will also help us at Bootcamp, like having a growth mindset. This will help because you understand why you should not give up.
        </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            I think it was a good use of time because I knew none of it. It did not feel like a waste of time because I can think of ways 
            that I would use the core skills at old jobs and I do think they will be useful in future jobs and at the Bootcamp.
        </p>


        <h1>Preparing for Bootcamp</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to use Dec Academy as a way to get into web development and start a career. I think Dev Academy will give me 
            all the skills I need to start and get a job. If I like the job I may decide to go to university to study computer science 
            and become a software developer if I think it will be a good investment at the time, but I don't think I will do this for a 
            good few years after Dev Academy, I also think Dev Academy will give me a feel for the industry and if it is where I want to 
            put all my time and effort or if it isn't suited for me.
        </p>

        <h2>hat do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
            I think I still have strengths and weaknesses as before but I also think I do need to be in the right headspace to learn, 
            I have found this when doing the mack-a-mole problem. I did spend a day on the problem and it was not working. Bits of it 
            did work but I was constantly getting stuck and stuff just was not making sense to me. So the next day I left it and did the 
            dress the clown then came back to it in the afternoon, deleted all my code and did it in like an hour which made me feel good. 
            To keep me in a good headspace I think I need to take breaks, but not too frequently because it is hard to get back into my 
            work. Because of this and because I get stuck into my work sometimes I just don't want to take a break so I'll put it off until 
            I have lost concentration.
        </p>

        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>
            The two biggest I can think of is staying focused for 9 weeks and being around people so much. I may lose motivation or focus 
            over the 9 weeks so I just need to keep reminding myself why I am here and that I am here my own choice. I also think being 
            around people a lot does drain me, I do like to spend time alone to recharge but I will not have a lot of time to do that 
            because of how long the weeks are. This may make me lose motivation and fall behind work as a result.
        </p>

        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        <p>
            I do want to learn how to network mostly. I think this will help me a lot at Bootcamp and more importantly for me in the job 
            market and later on in life. I am also not the best working in teams because I think I work better alone than in a team because 
            I would rather just get stuck in with the work than decide on a plan that works well with the whole team, I am also not very good 
            at communicating my ideas so I don't contribute much to the planning stage of the project. I do like to work with a team when we 
            all get along well. But in teams where there is a clash in personalities like two people trying to lead the project is the most 
            annoying thing for me.
        </p>

        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <P>
            I will try to do all the hard work at the beginning of the week so I have more time at the end of the week to go through the 
            easier work. When I do get stuck I will try to fix it by myself first because if I do I am more likely to remember how I fixed 
            it. If I can not I will ask for help from a facilitator or another student who I think might have it.
        </P>
