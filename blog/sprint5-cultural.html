        <h1>Reflection of Foundation Core Skills</h1>

        <h2 class="left-margin">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li>
                I learned that my brain changes shape and I can use that to learn better and more effectively which I will try to remember 
                for the rest of my life and use as much as I can.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I did learn I need to practice something as soon as I read about it or watch a video about it. For example, when I learned 
                about .map function I did not practice with it enough so I need to do that before I can 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I did find out that I need to slow down sometimes and take care with what I do. I have miss spelled stuff that has made my 
                code not work and its just a small thing but I do have to go through a lot just to figure it out.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="left-margin">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            You need values, empathy and self-awareness do help you get a job. If there is someone better than you at coding 
            (and there always is) you can still get the job if you show these skills because people want people who can work well 
            with other people because you can relate to them. Because of this, you will be more effective in a team and can get 
            much more work done.
        </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            The thing that surprised me the most was that I could relate almost everything I learned to past experience I have had, 
            and how I could have used them to better myself and my relationships with others. For example, if I knew about emotional 
            intelligence longer ago I would have handled myself differently when interacting with people I didn't like. I was quite 
            petty with some people I didn't like or would be passive aggressive to another. 
        </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            I found the meditation the most challenging because I hadn't done it before and as a result of this it was hard to stay 
            still for so long while doing nothing but focusing on my breath, but it did get easier and easier the more I did it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think so much time is spent on it because at the end of the Bootcamp we should be able to get a job and if you do not 
            display some of the stuff we learned in core it will be much more difficult to get a job. Some of the core stuff we learned 
            will also help us at Bootcamp, like having a growth mindset. This will help because you understand why you should not give up.
        </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            I think it was a good use of time because I knew none of it. It did not feel like a waste of time because I can think of ways 
            that I would use the core skills at old jobs and I do think they will be useful in future jobs and at the Bootcamp.
