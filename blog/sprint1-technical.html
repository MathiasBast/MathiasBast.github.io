    <h1>Branch, Pull, Merge With GitBash</h1>
    <h2>What is GitBash?</h2>
    <p>
      GitBash Is a command console that is useful to GitHub users like myself, and it does run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is use for handeling your local and remote repositories and making changes to them without overriding someone elses work. This does use the Git part which is a version control software. It is very useful for teams of people who work together because without version control a lot of time can be waisted because copies can be deleted accidently, you can make mistakes and save them. With a version control like Git this will not happen because everyone has a copy so even if someone somehow deletes the master repositorty on GitHub it can be pushed back up on their from anyteam member who pulled it down most recently. If anyone makes a mistake and saves it you can go back to a previous commit because they are all kept and easy to find. Git is very good for all group work and it does save a lot of time. The Bash part is easy to use once you know the commands you need and you can do a lot from it, and way more than I thought they were able to do.
