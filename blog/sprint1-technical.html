    <h1>Add, Commit, and push With GitBash</h1>
    <h2>What is GitBash?</h2>
    <p>
      GitBash Is a command console that is useful to GitHub users like myself, and it does run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is use for handeling your local and remote repositories and making changes to them without overriding someone elses work. This does use the Git part which is a version control software. It is very useful for teams of people who work together because without version control a lot of time can be waisted because copies can be deleted accidently, you can make mistakes and save them. With a version control like Git this will not happen because everyone has a copy so even if someone somehow deletes the master repositorty on GitHub it can be pushed back up on their from anyteam member who pulled it down most recently. If anyone makes a mistake and saves it you can go back to a previous commit because they are all kept and easy to find. Git is very good for all group work and it does save a lot of time. The Bash part is easy to use once you know the commands you need and you can do a lot from it, and way more than I thought they were able to do.

    <h2>What Does it Do?</h2>
    <p>
      GitBash can do many things but the ones I find most useful are Add, Commit and Push. These are the commands that let you put your work on the remote repository so it can be seen on your GitHub profile. Anyone can access the remote repository if it is public so they can fork it then clone it then make changes to it and then add, commit and push it back up to their remote repository where they can request to make try to merge the changes they made with my current project, this is why GitHub is a powerful tool because anyone with a GitHub account can help you with a project and improve your code if you let them. They can do anything from fix some spelling or grammar to rewrite a page if you allow it.
