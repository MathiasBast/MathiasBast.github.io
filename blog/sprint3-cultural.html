        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to keep your emotions under control and be able to see both sides of something. i.e you are angry at someone and you blame them instead of acknowledging that you do control your own feelings. It can also be understanding what is truly causing the feelings you feel the way you are, for example, you feel angry but your cat died a week ago and that is making you sad but you hide it as anger. </p>



        <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
        <img src="../images/IntelligencePic.JPG" alt="A dude looking smart" class="pic-float">
        <P>IQ is a more traditional way of looking at smartness and you can not tell how you deal with emotions and reading people. It is normally thought the higher your IQ the smarter you are and this is true in one sense but there is much more to it. EI is about how you read people which is the biggest difference because IQ does not touch on how you can deal with people and your own emotions. It is important to have a good EI because it is important almost everywhere you go. For example, if you had a good EI, so you could communicate well and could read how the other person was feeling and showed it you are much more likely to get hired because employers look for people who can work well in teams, and will not conflict with people who are already working there.</P>

        <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
        <p>People do like people who can read their emotions and react in an appropriate manner, like if someone is feeling sad and you can see it in the way they act then they may want to talk about it or to be treated differently or if you did something and you should be able to tell if you annoyed them and they are now upset with you other than carrying on and making them more annoyed.</p>
