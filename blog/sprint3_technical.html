        <h1>DOM Exploration</h1>
        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
        <p>DOM does stand for Document Object Model. An Object Model is a "logical interface, software or system that is modeled through the use of object-oriented techniques. It enables the creation of an architectural software or system model prior to development or programming."  The DOM does represent the page and is responsible for showing all the document structure, style, and content but we never see the DOM.</p>
        
        <p>The DOM shows the document as nodes and objects so HTML, CSS, and JS can connect to the page to make changes to the pages that we make. Both the code we write and the user interface on the browser are represented by the DOM.</p>
        
        <img src="../images/DomPic.JPG" alt="A picture that shows the DOM structure">

        <p>The DOM is built by multiple API's(application program interface) that build it together. APIs are sets routines, protocols, and tools that make programs but they always do it in the background so we do never see them make them. JavaScript (and other programming languages) can access the DOM to make changes to the document and features on the document. The changes can be as small as changing text or replacing the whole document. Without the DOM JavaScript could not change the page or anything on the page. The pages content is stored in the DOM and can be accessed and changed with JavaScript or even the DevTools on your browser. The DOM does allow make the structural representation of the page available in one consistent API which makes it easier to use and more accessible. </p>

        <p>Whenever you change the document, children, making a button, etc... on the document you are accessing the DOM to change it.  The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page.</p>
