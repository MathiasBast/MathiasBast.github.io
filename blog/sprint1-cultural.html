        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
        
        <h2>My values</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li>Loyalty</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Kindness</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Determination</li>
            <li>Tolerance of Differences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        
        <p>I am determined and hardworking and love a good challenge.</p>

        <p>I am easily distracted and can be shy to people I don't know.</p>

        <p>I think the strength that will help me the most is determination and tenacious because of how the Bootcamp is. There will be long hours and a lot of work to get done but I think I will be motivated enough to get through it.</p>
        
        <p>At high school, I did have to work in groups and I did not always get to choose who was in my group because of this I did end up in groups with people who I did not like because of this it did affect my workflow. To combat this I did find out what I needed to do in the group and did get working and avoided him in the group and got stuck into my work. This has also happened when I worked at Pak'N'Save and there were some team members there that I did not get along with but and Pak'N'Save does put a lot of emphasis on teamwork among employees so I would ask to help someone else out instead of the person I was with, because of this I did get a lot more work done and it felt good.</p>

        <h2>Stories</h2>
        <p>I and my mum and sister were heading to the beach and stopped at Countdown on the way there so I could get some sausages and bread for a leaving work bbq and got my mum Whittaker's chocolate bar and my sister a bag of sour patch lollies. (I showed kindness by getting them a treat)</p>

        <p>When I was working on a religious education assignment for school and someone did offer to type some up for me and I said I don't want them to because that would be plagiarism.</p>

        <p>One of my friends left school and got mixed up with some bad influences and set her life off track and lost sight of her goals, so I did try to get her to get back on the path and when that didn't work I did distance myself from her so I would not get sucked into that lifestyle.</p>
