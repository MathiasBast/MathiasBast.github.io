        <h2>My values</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li>Loyalty</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Kindness</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Determination</li>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        
        <p>I am determand and hardworking, and love a good challange.</p>

        <p>I am easly distracted and can be shy to people I don't know.</p>

        <p>I think the strength that will help me the most is determination and tenacious because of how the bootcamp is. There will be long hours and a lot of work to get done but I think I will be motivated enough to get trough it.</p>
        
        <p>At high school I did have to work in groups and I did not always get to choose who was in my group because of this I did end up in groups with people who I did not like because of this it did effect my work flow. To combat this I did find out what I needed to do in the group and did get working and avoided him in the group and got stuck into my work. This has also happend when I worked at Pak'N'Save and there were some team members there that I did not get along with but and Pak'N'Save does put a lot of emphisis on teamwork amoung employies so I would ask to help someone else out instead of the person I was with, because of this I did get a lot more work done and it felt good.</p>

        <h2>Stories</h2>
        <p>Me my mum and sister were heading to the beach and stopped at countdown on the way there so I could get some sausages and bread for a leaving work bbq and got my mum a whittakers choclate bar and my sister a bag of sour patch lollies.(I showed kindness by getting them a treat)</p>

        <p>When I was working on a religous education assighment for school and someone did offer to type some up for me and I said I don't want them to because that would be plagiarism.</p>

        <p>One of my friends left school and got mixed up with some bad influinces and set her life of track and lost sight of her goals, so I did try get her to get back on path and when that didn't work I did distance myself from her so I would not get sucked into that lifestyle.</p>
