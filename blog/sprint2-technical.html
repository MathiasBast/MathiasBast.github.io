    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    
    <h2>What are Margins?</h2>
    <img class="pic-float" src="../images/MarginExample1.JPG" alt="Margin set up">
    <P>Margins are set up in the CSS of a page, and are gaps you can put around elements. Margins are measured in px, pt, cm, and more. They do surround an element so each side can have a different sized margins</P>
    <br>
    <h2>What do Margins do?</h2>
    <p>Margins do separate elements on a page, this is usually to make it more presentable i.e so things are not jammed up together. They can be applied to any element trough a class, id or style in the same line.</p>

    <h2>What are borders</h2>
    <img class="pic-float" src="../images/BorderExample1.JPG" alt="Border set up">
    <p>Borders in CSS are just like boarders everywhere, they are there for look. There are different types of boarders i.e solid, dotted, dashed, ect... . They can also have different colors, thickness and roundness of the corners.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What do Borders Do?</h2>
    <p>Boarders are used to make something look contained and easier to look at. It can also be used to seperate two elements if they are too close together and make things look more presentable.</p>
  
    <h2>What is Padding</h2>
    <img class="pic-float" src="../images/PaddingExample1.JPG" alt="Padding set up">
    <p>Padding is useful for spacing out your webpage more. You can make slight changes with it but there are not as many changes to it in the CSS as you can with other things. The only one I use is the length but there is also %, initial and inherit.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What Does Padding Do?</h2>
    <p>Padding does make space between the content and the border, and is used when the border is touching the content or it does look bad with it close together.</p>

    <h2>More Infomation</h2>
    <p>They are all parts of the CSS code which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the part of the code for making stuff look pretty. I find the w3schools pages on Margins, Padding and Borders really helpful.</p>
